# Subjective Hallucination Scale (SHS)

The **Subjective Hallucination Scale (SHS)** is a lightweight, human-centered evaluation instrument for assessing hallucination tendencies in Large Language Models (LLMs).

Inspired by established psychometric tools such as the **System Usability Scale (SUS)** and the **System Causability Scale (SCS)**, SHS provides a fast, interpretable, and domain-agnostic way to capture how humans perceive factual inconsistency, incoherence, and misleading reasoning in model-generated text.

## Idea

While hallucinations are widely recognized as a core limitation of modern LLMs, the field still lacks a simple, standardized, and user-facing instrument to assess them systematically.

SHS addresses this gap by offering:
- a **10-item Likert-scale questionnaire**
- alternating positive and negative statements to reduce response bias
- a scoring scheme compatible with SUS-style interpretation (0–100)

The scale is designed for **quick application** in research, evaluation studies, benchmarking, and real-world deployments.

## What is hosted here

This repository hosts:
- the **SHS scale definition**
- documentation and usage guidelines
- supporting tools and materials for applying SHS in studies and evaluations
